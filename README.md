# Cardano Mesh Course — Hands-On Learning & Examples

Welcome! 🚀 This repository is a **hands-on implementation and walkthrough** of the official **Cardano Course** using the Mesh SDK and Aiken smart contracts.  
We’ll build each lesson one by one, **track progress**, **document insights**, and **share working code**.

The goal is both to **learn deeply** and to **invite the community** to follow along, ask questions, and contribute.

---

## 📘 What We’re Learning

This repo follows the official Cardano Course from Mesh, covering:

1. Introduction & Hello World
2. Multi-Signature Transactions
3. Aiken Smart Contracts
4. Contract Testing
5. Blueprint Interpretation
6. Vesting Contracts
7. Plutus NFT Contracts
8. Scaling with Hydra
9. Web3 Services integration

As we progress, each lesson will have:

- A **folder with code**
- A **summary of concepts**
- **Instructions to run/test locally**
- Notes about real-world usage

---

## 🛠 Technologies

We’ll be using:

- **Mesh SDK** — TypeScript SDK for building Cardano dApps and contracts :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
- **Aiken** — Smart contract language for Cardano :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- **GitHub Codespaces** — To make the setup reproducible and shareable
- **Node.js & TypeScript**

---

## 🚀 Setting Up

You can use **GitHub Codespaces** to start coding instantly:

1. Click **Code → Open with Codespaces**
2. Start a new Codespace
3. Follow the per-lesson setup in the “lessons/” folder

*(Specific steps for environment setup will be documented in Lesson 1.)*
